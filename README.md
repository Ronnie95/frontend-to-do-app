# frontend-to-do-app
Everyone has different methods of organizing task. Some may use sticky notes(which your limited characters) some use notebook paper(which is easy to lose, one coffee spill and you missed your 3:00PM pilates class) and if you have none of those options you may try to memorize your tasks!
these methods can be convienent for many, but not everyone has the best memory, the ability to keep paper clean or non damaged, and the penmanship to cram alot of task on a sticky note.
My to do app will be convienent for all it's users making it easy to operate, great design, and a peace of mind!
